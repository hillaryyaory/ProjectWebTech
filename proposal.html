<h1> What is your website about?

<p>I want to create a portfolio website dedicated to current and past product design projects I've worked on. I used to intern at Liberty Society, a fashion enterprise. There I designed their merchandise and I also worked with their clients to bring their products to life. 
However, I am also a current UI/UX designer at Jemi, a no code website builder. I help them create basic/aesthetic website templates for different use cases (e.g. ecommerce, art portfolio, etc.) for the general public as well as specific clients. 
I would like to create this portfolio website to showcase my artistic background. </p>

<h1>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</h1>

<p>For me, my objective for creating the website is to 
1. Tell my professional narrative in a creative way
I want a good portfolio website to showcase my skills and experience to employers/recruiters. 
My website would provide relevant information about my skills, experience, and projects you've worked on.
The portfolio takes an employer deeper, so they can actually feel and visualize what it's like to work with you, creatively and professionally, and then lets them experience your results.

2. Being able to express myself creatively and showcase work I'm proud of
I would like to make a gallery of some sort for my artistic projects. I'm super proud of everything I've created in the past and would like to have it easily accessible. 
By creating this portfolio website I would have all my works well organized in one place, like an online gallery. 

3. Educational
I would like to share my experiences as to how I became a product designer. I want to be resourceful and help others. 
With my website, I would be able to show the applications I used and the process behind designing my designs.</p>

<h1>Who is your target audience?</h1>
<p>My target audience would be employers/recruiters who would want to learn more about my background. 
Another target audience would be those who like digital art, like website templates, drawings/sketches, and fashion. They could be interested in my designs. 
Lastly, another target audience could be people who are interested in learning more about what it means to be a product designer. </p>

<h1>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h1>
<p>My website would have a page dedicated to my past projects/current projects I'm working on, the process of my product design, career and professional goals, resumes/references/list of achievements/expertise, the about me section, homepage/welcome section, sitemap, contact/feedback pages.</p>
